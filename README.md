# Reflection
I created this project as part of a class project in order to develop my understanding of python data structures as well as familiarize myself with python syntax.

My solver is highly efficient with the following stats:

Total Rounds: 2000
Rounds Not Solved: 11
Total Guesses: 7476
Average Guesses Per Round: 3.738
Solver Time elapsed: 60.38
Rounds Per Second = 33

Note: The wordle solver is tested on 7 letter words/guesses instead of the usual 5

The Wordle GUI was created with TKinter in order to learn some python UI.
